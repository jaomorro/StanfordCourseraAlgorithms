"""
In this assignment you will implement one or more algorithms for the all-pairs shortest-path problem.

Your task is to compute the "shortest shortest path". Precisely, you must first identify which,
if any, of the three graphs have no negative cycles. For each such graph, you should compute
all-pairs shortest paths and remember the smallest one (i.e., compute \min_{u,v \in V} d(u,v)min
u,vâˆˆV d(u,v), where d(u,v)d(u,v) denotes the shortest-path distance from uu to vv).

If each of the three graphs has a negative-cost cycle, then enter "NULL" in the box below.
If exactly one graph has no negative-cost cycles, then enter the length of its shortest
shortest path in the box below. If two or more of the graphs have no negative-cost cycles,
then enter the smallest of the lengths of their shortest shortest paths in the box below.
